Background, Context and Aim:

Modern measures of development such as the Human Development Index (HDI) use national averages like life expectancy, GDP per capita and education years. These indicators often obscure the individual socioeconomic experience, with national averages failing to capture inequalities within countries. Before the HDI grew in popularity, in the 1970s Richard J Estes established the Weighted Index of Social Progress (WISP) (MIQOLS, 2020), focusing on individual experience rather than national figures.

This project aims to determine whether Estes’  WISP meaningfully represents human experience by creating clusters beyond the standard ‘developed, developing and underdeveloped’ categorisation, helping answer the following research question:

Is Estes’ Weighted Index of Social Progress an Effective Indicator of Human Experience?
