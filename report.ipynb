        "\n",
        "Modern measures of development such as the Human Development Index (HDI) use national averages like life expectancy, GDP per capita and education years. These indicators often obscure the individual socioeconomic experience, with national averages failing to capture inequalities within countries. Before the HDI grew in popularity, in the 1970s Richard J Estes established the Weighted Index of Social Progress (WISP) (MIQOLS, 2020), focusing on individual experience rather than national figures.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to determine whether Estes’  WISP meaningfully represents human experience by creating clusters beyond the standard ‘developed, developing and underdeveloped’ categorisation, helping answer the following research question:\n",
        "\n",
        "Is Estes’ Weighted Index of Social Progress an Effective Indicator of Human Experience?\n",
        "\n",
        "##Intended Audience\n",
        "\n",
        "The intended audience for a human development project is vast, with academics, the public, policy makers and business stakeholders all having use cases - a more nuanced understanding of human development could support decisions across many fields. For example, NGOs focused on health or education may wish to know areas where significant social deficiencies lay, despite economic success of a country. Microfinance organisations may want to identify finance-poor areas that are not conflict-ridden. While potential migrants hoping to start a new life may wish to consult the index to verify that economic advancement does not necessarily correlate with social wellbeing and the society may be socially regressive.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first visualisation shows how each cluster is formed. The second shows global patterns spatially, revealing trends on how countries group together based on social indicators rather than economic averages.\n",
        "Justification of Investigation, Modelling and Interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "##Data Sourcing and Pre-Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "WISP and country boundary data were sourced from open-source locations to ensure reproducibility. Initial exploration revealed several key data issues that could impact the validity and reliability of the analysis. These were addressed using standardisation (common format) and normalisation (minimised redundancy) techniques (DataCalculus, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Column headers were generally uniform - lowercase, with underscores – less one, which was changed. Redundant columns removed. Mismatched country codes were identified. Non-country entries like \"North America\" or \"Developed Countries\" were removed from the data. Namibia’s code \"NA\" had been converted to a null and was reverted to string form.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, territories and microstates lacked WISP data, but were retained in the spatial dataset and later greyed out on the map for completeness. Duplicate country codes, like Portugal and the Azores sharing  ‘PT’ were resolved by renaming the Azores to ‘PT (Azores Islands)’. The cleaned data was merged using country codes, and the CRS was adjusted for global fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Cluster Creation – Exploratory Analysis and Modelling\n",
        "\n",
        "So that relationships among WISP subindices can be assessed, Spearman’s rank correlation was used—preferable to Pearson’s due to its robustness against outliers seen in the data (Analytics Yogi, 2025). The spatial distribution of each subindex was mapped globally for initial insight.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to cluster the data, the Elbow Method was first used to identify the point at which increasing cluster numbers yielded diminishing returns. As expected, a distinct \"elbow\" suggested a three-cluster solution, echoing traditional development categories. However, this project’s goal was to go beyond such simplifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Kodinariya et al. (2013) recommends combining the Elbow Method with the Silhouette Score to find a more reliable cluster count. The Silhouette Score, which balances intra-cluster cohesion with inter-cluster separation, revealed a plateau after the first drop from three clusters, with another drop after six. This led to the selection of six clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Murphy (2012) proposes that a K-Means cluster model allows for unsupervised machine learning, i.e. without needing predefined labels: it’s the clusters that will actually later define the labels. A K-Means model was then processed with six clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Cluster Categorisation – Exploratory Analysis and Interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "A pair-plot of subindices revealed clear trends. One small cluster stood out, made up of just Libya and Eritrea. Whilst this might suggest over-clustering, these countries’ outlier - military spending - is extremely high, justifying their separation. Eritrea, for example, spent 35.46% of its GDP on military expenditure in 2020 (countryeconomy.com, 2025), compared to the global average of 2.4% (SIPRI, 2021). A unique case like this warrants its own category regarding authoritarian governance and militarisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other clusters also revealed certain patterns. One grouped similar war-torn nations like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria. Unexpectedly, Brazil appeared in the most advanced cluster, while China was clustered with less developed countries - despite both being developing BRICS economies. This distinction illustrates the value of WISP -  while China outperforms economically, Brazil outperforms socially, particularly on women’s rights, military presence and environmental progress. This distinction highlights how development trajectories differ despite being among nations of similar economic status. While China’s growth is likely state-led and based on infrastructure investment, Brazil’s is likely is more from civil rights and environmental initiatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results clearly support the idea that WISP captures more complex and meaningful social patterns that GDP-based indices miss. Cluster labels were assigned based on their median subindex values.\n",
        "Non-Spatial Visualisation\n",
        "\n",
        "The first visualisation is a faceted bar chart showing subindex medians by cluster. It helps to understand each group’s characteristics and interpret the spatial map.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pre-processing involved identifying the most significant outliers: -59.6 and -8.35. The extreme value distorted scale and was truncated with a footnote for user context. The remaining data was adjusted by adding 10 to all values, allowing bars to sit along the x-axis. The y-axis was extended below zero, justified by the fact that all data were z-score standardised and therefore only meaningful in comparative terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of bars meant that to colouring using the colourblind palette became an issue due to similar shades, to circumvent this, other visual cues could be used, like icons (Medium, 2021). This approach improved clarity for colourblind users while enhancing general visual comprehension. Since they weren’t relying solely on shades, users could match icons and colours, avoiding the need to frequently cross-reference a legend.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Spatial Visualisation\n",
        "\n",
        "The second visualisation is an interactive, colour-coded world map showing each country’s cluster. A colourblind palette from Wong (Nichols, 2025) was used for accessibility and clear distinction among all six clusters. Using a colourblind-friendly palette also helped differentiate this visualisation from the bar chart avoiding colour duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interactive elements such as pop-ups provide specific country subindex data for greater context. Due to minor misalignments between shapefile and basemap borders, a low-contrast basemap was used to reduce visual inconsistencies, though they are not significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although a static map was considered for clarity and text elements, the interactive version added more value by allowing users to explore subindex scores. Instead, contextual notes and a legend were added in the command cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This project has seen the full data science process (Gupta, 2022) – collecting high-quality, open-access historical data; cleaning it to ensure common format and minimised redundancy for analysis; performing exploratory data visualisation and correlation analysis and adopting multiple techniques to determine cluster numbers; modelling using a K-Means clustering algorithm; and creating visualisations to support interpretation and deployment of data.\n",
        "All outputs adhered to the FAIR data principles (OpenAIRE, 2025) via the use of consistent comments, links, citations and references, and well-structured code. The code could be reused to explore WISP data across decades, enabling temporal studies of social development offering insights into whether development is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same, or whether it is sustained or cyclical.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although WISP is less popular today, overshadowed by GDP-focused indices like HDI, its long history and emphasis on social progress give it a distinct use case. It offers a deeper understanding of human development, capturing dimensions that GDP metrics miss - such as governance, freedom, and social equality.\n",
        "\n",
        "To answer the research question: Is WISP an effective indicator of human experience? This project suggests it is. The clusters reveal clear social patterns often hidden by economic measures, and visualisations confirm WISP’s ability to emphasise nuanced social differences. Its continued use could help provide better-informed decisions across policy, migration, finance, and academic research.\n",
        "\n",
        "While no single index can perfectly grasp human development, WISP offers a rare perspective by valuing social equality, governance, and cohesion as much as economic metrics. It emphasises lived experience in a world where metrics are defined by averages and totals.\n",
